\title{Convert Java code to R code}
\usage{
java_to_r(java)
}
\arguments{
\item{java}{A character string containing the Java code to be converted to R, or a filename with the Java code.}
}
\value{
If the input is a character string, the resulting R code will be printed and returned as a character string.
        If the input is a filename, the resulting R code will be saved as a file with the same name as the input file, but with the extension `.R`, and the filename will be returned.
}
\description{
This function takes Java code as input and returns the corresponding R code.
It uses GPT-4 powered chat to perform the code conversion.
}
\details{
This function is not guaranteed to provide perfect conversions and might produce invalid R code in some cases.
         Users are encouraged to verify the output code carefully.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Convert a simple Java code snippet to R
java_code <- "public class HelloWorld {
               public static void main(String[] args) {
                 System.out.println(\"Hello, world!\");
               }
             }"
r_code <- java_to_r(java_code)
cat(r_code)

# Convert Java code from a file and save the result to an R file
input_file <- "path/to/java_file.java"
output_file <- java_to_r(input_file)
